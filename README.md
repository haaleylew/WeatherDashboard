# WeatherDashboard
# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

In  this application I utilized AJAX to hook into OpenWeather API to get data into JSON format. Using HTML and CSS powered by jQuery this shows city, date, icon image, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. As well as a 5 day forcast for the same weather conditions. Then the application will store previous search results for the user. I Used JQuery, javascript, html, css, momentjs, bootstrap and the openweather api. 
    When the app is deployed

    Then the user is presented with the search bar

    When the a city is enter

    Then icons are presented representing the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

    Then the user is also shown a 5day forcast also showing the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

    When the user clicks on past search history

    Then they are presented with current and future conditions for that city
